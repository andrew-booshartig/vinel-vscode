# BetterVim

A native modal-editing state machine for VSCode. Not an emulation, and not a
Neovim bridge — the two existing approaches, and the two root causes behind
nearly every real, verified complaint about them (see "Why this should avoid
VSCodeVim's worst problems" below).

## What's here so far

**The modal engine — Milestone 1 (`src/state.ts`, `src/motions.ts`,
`src/extension.ts`).** NORMAL/INSERT modes — vim's own names, not an invented
vocabulary — following standard vim semantics as the target. (An earlier
Emacs-based prototype used its own POWER/EDIT terminology and had a few
Emacs-specific workarounds baked in — e.g. its `0`/`,` split; that prototype
is a reference for _mechanism_, not a spec copied verbatim — see the `0`/`$`/
`^` notes in `motions.ts`.) Where VSCode already does something excellently,
this uses it directly rather than reimplementing vim on top of it — `/` opens
VSCode's own native Find instead of a hand-built vim search.

- **Mode state**, per editor (like real vim — each buffer is independently
  Normal/Insert): a string context key (`betterVim.mode`, `'normal'` |
  `'insert'`), status-bar indicator, cursor shape sync (block ↔ line). Fresh
  editors default to NORMAL.
- **Escape → NORMAL** (spammable), **`i` → INSERT** while in NORMAL.
- **Digit-count prefix system** — VSCode has no built-in equivalent to
  Emacs's numeric prefix-arg, so this is hand-built: digits buffer into a
  pending count, shown in the status bar, consumed by the next motion
  (`5j` moves down 5 lines) and reset after. `0` is real vim: a motion
  (column 0) unless a count is already in progress, in which case it extends
  the count.
- **Core motions**, all count-aware: `h j k l` + arrows, `w b e` (word),
  `0 ^ $` (line), `g g` / `G` (buffer top/bottom), `{` / `}` (paragraph,
  vim's own blank-line-boundary definition — VSCode has no built-in for
  this), `/` (native Find).

**Known, deliberate v1 simplification:** real vim's cursor occupies a
character _cell_ (can't move past the last character on a line; `$` lands ON
it, not after). This milestone uses the conventional between-characters
model VSCode/Emacs both use (`$` = `cursorEnd`, lands after the last char).
Adopting the full character-cell model would touch nearly every motion —
worth its own deliberate decision later, not bundled in silently here.

**The modal engine — Milestone 2 (`src/operators.ts`, `src/registers.ts`).**
Vim's operator grammar: `[count1] operator [count2] motion` — the effective
repeat is count1 × count2 (`2d3w` deletes 6 words), or a doubled operator
letter (`dd`/`cc`/`yy`) meaning "N whole lines" from count1 alone. Scoped to
the highest-frequency subset first — text objects (`ci"`, `da(`) and
generalizing to _any_ motion (`dG`, `d}`) are follow-ons; the range-based
architecture here already supports them once wired up.

- **`d` / `c` / `y`** — open a pending operator (status bar shows e.g. `d…`),
  cancelled by Escape.
- **`dd` / `cc` / `yy`** — N whole lines. Delete/yank remove them entirely;
  `cc` instead empties down to ONE line and drops into INSERT, keeping vim's
  `autoindent` behavior: the new empty line preserves the changed line's own
  indentation (`    foo` → an empty line still indented to column 4). The one
  case that has no indent to preserve — an _already-blank_ line inside an
  indented block (VSCodeVim #1017) — falls back to VS Code's own language-
  aware reindenter (the same mechanism `o`/`O` use) to compute the block's
  indent. (Reindenting _unconditionally_ was wrong: on a content line the
  reindenter often recomputes to zero and eats the indent you had — so it's
  scoped to only the blank-line case.) Verified the range math against an
  offset-based splice simulation (both the indent-preserving and blank-line
  paths, plus first/middle/last line, multi-line counts, the true-end-of-
  buffer edge case, and single-line docs).
- **`dw` / `cw` / `yw`** — word-target, via the raw cursor-move command run
  `count1 × count2` times (not composed from the plain-motion functions,
  which each consume their own count once and would double-count if reused
  here as a black box).
- **`D` / `C`** — delete/change to end of line. **`Y`** — standard vim: means
  `yy` (yank the whole line), not "yank to end of line" — that reading is a
  non-default remap some configs add.
- **`x`** — cut N characters. **`p` / `P`** — paste after/before, register-
  aware: a linewise register (from `dd`/`yy`) pastes as new line(s); a
  charwise one (`dw`/`x`) pastes inline.
- **`o` / `O`** — open a line below/above, auto-indent, drop into INSERT.
- **`u` / `Ctrl+R`** — VSCode's native undo/redo directly.
- **The unnamed register** (`registers.ts`) — vim's default `"` register,
  what every op above reads/writes. Named registers (`a`-`z`) are a distinct,
  larger feature, not built here.

**The modal engine — VISUAL mode (`src/operators.ts`, `src/state.ts`,
`src/motions.ts`).** Both of vim's visual sub-modes: **`v`** charwise
(character-by-character) and **`V`** linewise (whole lines). Because VS Code's
`Selection` is already an `anchor`+`active` pair — exactly vim's visual model —
and VS Code ships `…Select` command variants (`cursorRightSelect`, `cursorMove`
with `select: true`), motions **extend the selection natively**: the same
motion code, the same count logic (including the fast native `j`/`k` count
path), just the Select variant when a selection is live. Operators reuse the
Milestone-2 machinery (`applyCharwiseRange`, `applyLinewise`, the register).

- **`v` / `V`** toggle and switch between each other and Normal; motions
  (`hjkl`, `w`/`b`/`e`, `0`/`^`/`$`, `gg`/`G`, `{`/`}`, counts) extend the
  selection. Linewise reshapes to whole lines on every motion (state.ts's
  `afterMotion`), stable across the anchor even when you cross it.
- **`d` / `c` / `y` / `x`** act on the selection immediately (no
  pending-operator wait); **`p`** pastes over it; **`o`** jumps to the other
  end. `>` / `<` indent, `J` joins, `~` / `u` / `U` change case — each returns
  to Normal after. (`u` in visual is _lowercase_, real vim — distinct from
  Normal `u` = undo.)
- **Delete / Backspace delete the selection** — the one deliberate QoL
  addition over strict vim, faster than `d`.
- **Known simplification:** charwise selection uses VS Code's own
  (exclusive-end) model, so it shows/affects exactly what's highlighted; real
  vim's visual is inclusive of the cell under the cursor (one char more). Same
  between-characters vs character-cell difference already noted for `$`,
  deferred to that same future decision.

**Input suppression (Normal + Visual behave like vim for unbound keys).** In
vim, a key with no command in Normal mode does _nothing_ — it never types.
VS Code's default is the opposite: an unbound printable key types its
character (and in Visual would replace the whole selection). BetterVim closes
that with a block of no-op bindings covering every printable key (plus
Enter/Backspace/Delete) at `betterVim.mode != 'insert'`, declared **first** so
every real command binding — declared after — overrides it via VS Code's
last-match-wins resolution. Net effect: only keys we've actually bound do
anything in Normal/Visual; everything else is silent, exactly like vim. Insert
mode is untouched (typing stays 100% native). Adding a real command later
"wins" for free, so this needs no per-key maintenance. (Chord prefixes `g`,
`z`, `>`, `<` are deliberately _not_ suppressed — a lone-key binding would
pre-empt their chords `gg`/`zz`/`>>`/`<<`.)

**The modal engine — daily-driver Normal-mode coverage.** The everyday commands
that make Normal mode feel complete, all count-aware and (where they're
motions) Visual-aware:

- **Insert-entry:** `a` append, `A` append-at-EOL, `I` insert-at-first-nonblank,
  `s` substitute char, `S` substitute line (= `cc`), `X` delete-before.
- **Find-char:** `f` / `F` / `t` / `T` + `;` / `,` repeat, and `r` replace —
  built on a small "await one keystroke" layer (a `betterVim.awaitingChar`
  context key + a `provideChar` binding for every printable key, declared
  **last** so it wins only while waiting). They double as operator targets:
  `dt,`, `df)`, `cf"` all work (`f`/`F` include the target char, `t`/`T` stop
  short) — same declarative, no-`type`-hijack approach as suppression.
- **Motions:** `W` / `B` / `E` (WORD, whitespace-delimited), `%` (matching
  bracket — native `jumpToBracket` / `selectToBracket`), `-` / `+` / `_` / `g_`
  (first/last-non-blank line motions), `H` / `M` / `L` (viewport top/mid/bottom
  via `visibleRanges`).
- **Search & scroll:** `n` / `N` (repeat native Find), `*` / `#` (word under
  cursor, via `nextSelectionMatchFindAction`), `Ctrl-D` / `Ctrl-U` (half page),
  `Ctrl-F` / `Ctrl-B` (page), `zz` / `zt` / `zb` (scroll current line to
  center/top/bottom via `revealLine`).
- **Line ops in Normal:** `J` join, `~` toggle-case, `>>` / `<<` indent/outdent.

**The modal engine — text objects (`src/textobjects.ts`).** `i` (inner) / `a`
(around) after an operator or in Visual: `ciw`, `daw`, `di"`, `ca(`, `yi{`,
`vip`, … The span comes from a pure range engine (`textObjectRange`) — easy to
test, no VS Code commands — and is applied through the same
`applyCharwiseRange`/`applyLinewise` path everything else uses.

- **Objects:** `iw`/`aw` word, `iW`/`aW` WORD, `i"`/`i'`/`` i` `` quotes,
  `i(`/`ib` `i{`/`iB` `i[` `i<` bracket pairs (balanced, multi-line), `ip`/`ap`
  paragraph — each inner and around.
- **Seek forward (across lines):** if the cursor isn't already inside/on a
  quote or bracket object, it seeks forward through the document to the next
  one — so `di[` / `ci"` find the next occurrence no matter what line it's on
  (nvim-faithful), then act on its matched pair. An enclosing pair always wins
  over a later one.
- **Input:** `i`/`a` are context-dependent — a text-object prefix when an
  operator is pending (`diw`) or in Visual (`viw`), otherwise plain
  Insert/append. The object key arrives via a `betterVim.awaitingTextObject`
  keystroke layer (the same await-a-keystroke pattern as find-char), so no
  `type` hijack. Off any object (`ci"` with no quotes) it's a no-op, like vim.

**The modal engine — dot-repeat (`.`) (`src/dotrepeat.ts`).** Repeat the last
change. Non-insert changes (`x`, `dd`, `dw`, `diw`, `dt,`, `>>`, `J`, `~`, `r`,
`p`, …) record a thunk that RE-COMPUTES at the current cursor, so `.` acts
wherever you are. Insert-entering changes (`ciw`, `cc`, `C`, `s`, `o`, `A`,
`i`, …) also capture the text you typed: on entering Insert the cursor position
is remembered, and on Escape the document span from there to the cursor IS the
typed text — so `.` replays the operator *and* the text (e.g. `ciwfoo<Esc>`
then `.` changes the next word to `foo`).

- **No per-keystroke listener.** The typed text is read once, at Escape (no
  `onDidChangeTextDocument`) — consistent with the scaling invariants.
- **Count override:** `N.` repeats with count N (`x` then `3.` deletes three).
- **Yank isn't a change** — `.` never repeats `y`/`yy`.
- Known limits (pragmatic): moving the cursor with arrows *mid-insert* can skew
  the captured text (linear typing is exact — vim has its own quirks here); an
  insert-change `.` may be 1–2 undo stops (best-effort merged).

**Not yet built** (future milestones): macros (likely delegate to the
`kb-macro` extension), marks (`m`/`` ` ``/`'`), named registers (`"a`),
ex-commands (`:`, `:%s/` → native find/replace), blockwise visual (`Ctrl-V`),
replace mode `R`, tag/sentence text objects (`it`/`at`, `is`/`as`), and
`>{motion}` as a full indent operator. Each is safe to add incrementally —
inert until bound, never typing.

## Why this should avoid VSCodeVim's worst problems

Researched against VSCodeVim's own GitHub issue tracker (real issue titles
and vote counts, not secondhand summaries) plus a from-scratch architectural
analysis. These are locked-in design invariants, not incidental — they're
the actual reason a native state machine should sidestep the community's
most-upvoted complaints, and they need to stay true as more gets built:

- **Never hijack the `type` command.** VSCodeVim's approach — parsing every
  keystroke through the extension host before it reaches the screen — is the
  root cause behind its top complaints: typing lag, dropped keystrokes on
  large files, and broken IME/CJK composition. NORMAL-mode keys here are
  discrete `contributes.keybindings`, each routed straight to one specific
  command; INSERT mode has **zero** custom keybindings — typing is 100%
  native VS Code, untouched, so none of that class of bug can occur.
- **Never build a shadow undo/text model.** "Pressing `u` will undo all the
  stack" is VSCodeVim's single most-upvoted open issue (177 votes) — a
  desynced shadow undo tree. `undo`/`redo` here call VS Code's own commands
  directly; there is no parallel undo history to fall out of sync.
- **Multi-count operators are already atomic.** `3dd`/`2d3w` compute the full
  target range _before_ editing, so each is exactly one `editor.edit()` call
  = one undo entry — pressing `u` once undoes the whole thing.
- **Macro requirement (future milestone, not built yet, but locked in now):**
  when macro replay is built, it must batch every edit into a single undo
  transaction using `editor.edit()`'s `undoStopBefore`/`undoStopAfter` flags
  — only the first edit in a replay gets a normal undo-stop-before, only the
  last a normal undo-stop-after, everything between suppresses both — so `u`
  after a macro undoes the whole macro in one step, not one sub-edit at a
  time. Written down here specifically because "macro replay breaks undo" is
  the exact failure mode behind VSCodeVim's #1 complaint, and it's much
  easier to get right from day one than to retrofit.
- **Scoped strictly to `editorTextFocus`.** Every keybinding is gated on it,
  and mouse events are never touched — the sidebar, file tree, breadcrumbs,
  and mouse-driven cursor placement are structurally untouched, unlike
  VSCodeVim's reported breakage there. Staying scoped this way (not
  extending `hjkl` into the tree/sidebar) is an **intentional non-goal**,
  not an oversight — that kind of overreach is exactly what causes those
  complaints.
- **Native goal-column tracking for free.** Vertical motion goes through VS
  Code's own cursor primitives (`moveUp`/`moveDown` issue a `cursorMove` with
  `by: 'wrappedLine'`, identical to `cursorUp`/`cursorDown`) rather than
  reimplementing cursor movement, so "cursor loses its column moving through
  uneven lines" isn't a bug class that can occur here.
- **Mode state never touches cursor position.** Switching tabs re-applies
  the target editor's remembered mode (context key, cursor style, status
  bar) but never moves the cursor — "cursor jumps to start of file after
  switching tabs" isn't reachable by this code path.
- **Ex-commands** (future milestone), when built, will delegate to VS Code's
  native find/replace-with-regex rather than a hand-rolled vim-regex
  translator — the same precedent as `/` → `actions.find` here already.

### Performance on big codebases (explicit scaling invariants)

"Vim gets slow / freezes on large files" is one of VSCodeVim's most-upvoted
complaints. These are the properties that keep this engine flat regardless of
file or project size — treated as invariants that every future feature must
preserve:

- **No per-keystroke document processing.** There is deliberately **no**
  `onDidChangeTextDocument` handler — nothing re-parses or re-scans the buffer
  on every edit. The only event subscribed is `onDidChangeActiveTextEditor`
  (fires on _tab switch_, not on typing), and its handler is O(1): set a
  context key, cursor style, and status-bar text. This is the single biggest
  reason a 50k-line file feels the same as a 50-line one.
- **Edits are one atomic operation regardless of count.** `1000dd` computes
  the whole range first and issues exactly one `editor.edit()` — it does not
  loop a per-line delete 1000 times.
- **Large counts use a native count argument, not N dispatches.** Vertical
  `j`/`k` pass `value: N` to a single `cursorMove`, so `500j` is one
  round-trip. The generic repeat-loop (`state.ts`'s `repeatCommand`) is
  reserved for motions whose counts are always tiny in practice (`3w`, `5l`);
  a new motion that could plausibly take a large count must use the native
  count path, not the loop.
- **Future features must not regress this.** VISUAL mode and beyond must not
  add a per-keystroke document scan or re-render on every selection change,
  and must keep edits to a single `editor.edit()` per operation.

## ⚠️ Testing this requires VSCodeVim disabled

VSCodeVim is very likely still installed and active in your VSCode profile.
It claims the exact same keys this extension does (`h j k l i` Escape,
digits…) via its own `vim.mode` context, completely independent of this
extension's `betterVim.mode` context — so with both active, the same
keypress can satisfy two unrelated extensions' keybindings at once, and which
one actually fires becomes unpredictable. Disable or uninstall VSCodeVim
before testing:

```
code --disable-extension vscodevim.vim
```

(Re-enable with `--enable-extension` if you want to compare behavior
side-by-side, but not both live in the same window at the same time.)

## Building

```
npm install
npm run compile
npm run package        # produces a .vsix
code --install-extension bettervim-0.0.1.vsix --force
```
